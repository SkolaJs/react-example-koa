Example of a general react.js work flow/build process using koa to serve pages

Jade is used as the templating engine, you can mix and match any engine that is compatible with `co-views`

This is meant to serve as a more concrete real world type example where the jsx is rendered as part of a build process.

    Build:
    `gulp`
    Develop (watch):
    `gulp dev`
